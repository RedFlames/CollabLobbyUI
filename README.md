# Collab Lobby UI

Search for **CollabLobby UI** in Olympus or get the mod on **GameBanana**: https://gamebanana.com/mods/429997

For any map with `ChapterPanelTrigger` entities from `CollabUtils2` (e.g. Spring Collab, Strawberry Jam, ... lobbies) there will be:

 - a menu you can pull up that lists all maps _(Default key: `M`)_
 - here you can "toggle" as many map waypoints as you like _(Default key: `Space`)_
 - teleport to the currently selected entry _(Default key: `T`)_
 - or clear all / toggle all waypoints on/off _(Default key: `R`)_
 - there's also some different sorting modes _(Default key: `S`)_
 - Controller also works for the menu, although there's no default set to open it


By default, all map locations will also be shown with their name within the Debug Map (F6 when Everest Debug is on), although this can be toggled off in the Settings.
